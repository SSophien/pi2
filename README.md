How to split a video

1. Install the required libs
  OpenCV (cv2)
    - pip install opencv-python
  
  Tk (Tkinter)
    - pip install Tk

2. Execute the code (you can change the number of images saved by setting the nbImg value)
  It will first open an explorer asking you to choose the video file
  Then a second explorer asking you where to save the images
